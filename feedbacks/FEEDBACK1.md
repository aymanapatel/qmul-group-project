The code submitted successfully compiles and runs. App is able to download content from the Web, parse it and answer some queries. Project is organised into separated modules for DB access, HTTP requests and parsing. Code is structured into complex modules, not sure why this number of modules or complexity. Good knowledge of Haskell demonstrated: IO, do notation, cases, including higher-order functions. There are some points in search where the structure is questionable. Why have a search that prints outcomes and returns to the main menu? Why not just have it return results? Basic Haddock documentation included, mainly comment before functions. Haddock style documentation in some files. Others do not include any comments. Database has two simple tables with a relationship between them. Three tables, road_status_logs references roads, while road_disruptions is independent. Function to fetch data from the web is of reasonable complexity, and handles common HTTP IO errors. Slightly complex (automatic) parsing of the downloaded data using the Aeson library. Report included clearly explains what the app aims to do, and how to use the app. Extra feature(s) included: Query functions are complex and interaction structured, though this is not mentioned as an extra feature in the report. I feel this is a mixed project, there is a lot of work here, but also quite a lot of repetition, and the structure is over-complex for the results. Good work, well done.
